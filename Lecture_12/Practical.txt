Practical Usage of Pandas from Proteomics Data:

1. Both Files are from SILAC treated samples after a MaxQuant Database Search:

Our Goals:

#Write Python Script that:
  1. Use the first column upon reading into Pandas as the index (row_name)
 	2. Remove Contaminants + Reverse (where those columns = '+')
 	3. Keep Protein Counts = 1
 	4. Sums the missing values:
 			a) generates a bargraph of missing values for each file
 	5. Keeps only the "normalized Ratio H/L columns" 
 	6. removes rows with missing values
        a) Writes out both files afterwards to a text file
 	7. keep only proteins that intersect in both files after all the filters
 	8. Perform a merge on the overlapping indexes(Protein_Names)
  9. Generate a boxplot after a log2 transformation
