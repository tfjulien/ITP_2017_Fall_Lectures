    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are part of object-oriented programming (OOB) which is a commonly used programming paradigm. Classes act as the templates for building these objects. By using classes large programs can be split into smaller units which each contain the logic that they require to function. Most programming languages support objects and in some, like python, everything is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Cartesian Distances:\n",
    "\n",
    "We would probably use either lists or tuples to represent points currently. This would allow for the two coordinates to be stored and accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pointA = (1, 1)\n",
    "pointB = (2, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"{A}, {B}\".format(A=pointA, B=pointB))\n",
    "print('A x:', pointA[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is nothing wrong with this approach, the downside is that it can become confusing using positional arguments. Dictionaries are able to solve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pointA = {'x': 1, 'y': 1}\n",
    "pointB = {'x': 2, 'y': 0}\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"{A}, {B}\".format(A=pointA, B=pointB))\n",
    "print('A x:', pointA['x'])\n",

    "A better approach would be to design a class(template) for a point.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As this current template is empty it does not do a very good job of defininf a point. The programmer still needs to manually specify the 'x' and 'y' coordinates for each point. Fortunately there is a way that this can be simplified. But a few new concepts need to be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The \\_\\_init\\_\\_() method\n",
    "    + This method will be called a single time when a new object is being created.\n",
    "    + When Point() was called in the previous example a new object was created.\n",
    "    + This enables the programmer to set up rules for creating the new object\n",
